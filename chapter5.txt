Financial points to note
It is increasingly common for parents to be involved in their children's divorce trials because they have given substantial monetary gifts that they want to reclaim after the marriages fail.
There are two lessons that such parents can learn from this court ruling.
1. Timing of the gift
Parents who want to give big gifts to their children only should do so way before the wedding and where possible, not in the presence of their spouses, so that the motive behind the gifts is clear. As the court ruled, gifts made during the wedding, especially during customary practices, will be viewed as being given to the couple, and not just the recipient.
2. Details of the gift
It is important to keep proper records of all valuable transactions so that you can always stake your claims later, if need be.
When it comes to disputes, documentary proof often helps to win the case.
That said, while it is important to have a good financial plan when couples get married, the best investment that anyone can make is to ensure that their marriage will last. After all, happily married old couples will tell you that their long-lasting relationship is more valuable than all the assets that they can ever own.

Another bone of contention was the husband's golf membership at the Singapore Island Country Club (SICC). It was valued at $225,000 during the trial last year, but now some members are putting theirs on the market for close to $300,000.
The husband is the chief executive of a company in the oil and gas sector while the wife is a dentist at a private clinic. The two, who are in their 30s, have a son who is seven this year.
It is notable that their divorce will become a reference for future cases after three judges of the Appellate Division of the High Court decided how valuable assets would be shared in a family.
Who owns that big hongbao
The million-dollar question was simply this - when the father of the groom handed over the gift at the tea ceremony, did he intend to give it to the couple or just to his son?
When this case came before the High Court, it ruled that the father had intended the money to go to his son only because the bride was given $20,000 worth of jewellery at the same ceremony.
And before the wedding, the groom's father had bought a $270,000 BMW car for his daughter-in-law, who also received jewellery worth $100,000 from her husband.
The judge noted that the husband later deposited the $1 million into his own bank account, not a joint one.
But the appeals court disagreed and ruled earlier this year that the money was meant for the couple and not just the husband, due to how and when the hongbao was given.
Judge of the Appellate Division Woo Bih Li noted that if the father had wanted to give the money to his son only, he could have done so before or after the wedding.
"However, he chose to do so at the tea ceremony for the marriage. This is a significant occasion where the parties pay their respects to senior members of the family," he said.
"The overt act of presenting a gift during such a ceremony would be viewed objectively as a gift to the couple in the absence of evidence to the contrary."

In particular, the wife also produced a compelling piece of evidence - a secretly recorded conversation where she and her husband spoke about the gift.
While this happened around two years after the wedding and when the marriage was already on the rocks, the couple's conduct sheds light on how they viewed the gift.
Justice Woo said: "We are mindful that the wife had recorded the conversation without the husband's knowledge and thus she had that advantage over him. Nevertheless, the substance of the conversation showed that the wife had explicitly asserted to the husband more than once that the $1 million gift was for both of them."
The husband did not correct her during the whole conversation by asserting that the gift was for him only. Instead, he gave various other reasons but in the end, he still relented and made the following remark: "It is for us, yes. But it is also for me to be the one that makes the decision. That's a reason why he gave me the money."
As a result, the court ruled that the husband could not keep the $1 million to himself and the money was included in the couple's matrimonial assets that were up for division.

The SICC membership
An asset that is owned prior to the marriage is usually excluded from the split during the divorce unless the other spouse has made substantial contribution or improvements to it.
The husband argued that his SICC membership should be excluded because it was a gift from his father before the marriage.
Moreover, he argued that even if the membership had been used for recreation or social purposes by both parties during the marriage, the wife did not make any monetary contribution to the membership since his father paid for it.
But the wife countered that the court was not shown any evidence that the father had indeed given the membership to the son prior to the marriage. This point would have been easy to prove if the husband had obtained relevant information from the club, such as when it was bought.

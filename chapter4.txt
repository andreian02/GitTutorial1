Justice Woo noted that none of these points were made known during the trial.
"While it could well be that the membership was acquired before the marriage and paid for by the father, it was for the husband to prove this, which he failed to do," he noted.
So the club membership became part of the matrimonial assets.
In all, the couple's combined pool of assets, which included the $1 million hongbao, the SICC membership, the husband's Maserati and the wife's BMW cars, were valued at about $2.4 million. The couple did not have their own property because they were living in a bungalow that was the home of the husband's parents.
As this was a short marriage and the bulk of the monetary contribution came from the husband, the wife was given over a third share of the pool, or about $820,000, because of her indirect contribution of taking care of their son.
